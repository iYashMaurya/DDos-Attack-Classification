# DDos Attack Classification

DDoS Attack means "Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attack" and it is a cybercrime in which the attacker floods a server with internet traffic to prevent users from accessing connected online services and sites.

This project aims to build machine learning models for classifying DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks using network traffic data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is :
```https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/solarmainframe/ids-intrusion-csv ```

Athough this is the small dataset you can always use the proper IDS dataset.
